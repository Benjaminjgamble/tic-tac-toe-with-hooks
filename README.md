## React Hooks are pretty cool!

This code is taken directly from here: https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gWWZgR?editors=0010
which is the initial React tutorial found here: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

Though this is not the best tutorial for showing the strengths of Hooks, it's a decent intro which we can look at in direct comparison to the original version. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
